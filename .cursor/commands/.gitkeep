# Cursor Commands Directory

This directory is for **custom Cursor IDE commands** that you create.

**Note:** The Spec-Kit commands (`/speckit.*`) mentioned in CURSOR.md are provided by the GitHub Spec-Kit extension, not by files in this directory. This directory is for your own custom commands.

## Adding Custom Commands

Create command files in this directory following Cursor's command format. Commands placed here will be automatically loaded by Cursor.

Example structure:
- `deploy-dotfiles.md` - Custom command for deploying dotfiles
- `test-module.md` - Custom command for testing modules
