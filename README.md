# What it is?!
Just adding some config files so I have them for later and have version control. If you're interested, feel free.

I broke the mac specific stuff out into it's own file. So if you don't have a mac, don't copy the bash_osx file.

# install
Clone the repo (be sure to grab submodules)

    git clone git@github.com:craveytrain/dotfiles.git

Get inside the repo

    cd dotfiles

Run the Rakefile

    rake install
