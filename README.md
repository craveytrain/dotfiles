# What it is?!
Just adding some config files so I have them for later and have version control. If you're interested, feel free.

This is primarily for a mac but parts in the bashrc labeled as 'OS X Only' can be stripped out to use it for any *nix system.

# How to install
## Copy files
* [bash_completion.d](https://github.com/craveytrain/local-config/tree/master/bash_completion.d) to ~/.bash_completion.d
* [bash_profile](https://github.com/craveytrain/local-config/blob/master/bash_profile) to ~/.bash_profile
* [bashrc](https://github.com/craveytrain/local-config/blob/master/bashrc) to ~/.bashrc
* [bin](https://github.com/craveytrain/local-config/tree/master/bin) to ~/bin
* [gitconfig](https://github.com/craveytrain/local-config/tree/master/gitconfig) to ~/.gitconfig (consider >> or manually merge in existing .gitconfig file)

## Set permissions
* Set ~/bin/bash_completion to executable
