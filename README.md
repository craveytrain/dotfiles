# What it is?!
Just adding some config files so I have them for later and have version control. If you're interested, feel free.

This is primarily for a mac but parts in the bashrc labeled as 'OS X Only' can be stripped out to use it for any *nix system.

# How to install
## Copy files
* [bash_completion.d] to ~/.bash_completion.d
* [bash_profile] to ~/.bash_profile
* [bashrc] to ~/.bashrc
* [bin] to ~/bin

## Set permissions
* Set ~/bin/bash_completion to executable
