#PSA

Bash is kinda broke in this repo right now. Please come back later.

# What it is?!
Just adding some config files so I have them for later and have version control. If you're interested, feel free to fork, poach, whatever.

# install
Clone the repo (be sure to grab submodules)

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:craveytrain/dotfiles.git

Get inside the repo

    cd dotfiles

Run the Rakefile

    rake install
