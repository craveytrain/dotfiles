<objective>
Start a new milestone through unified flow: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

This is the brownfield equivalent of new-project. The project exists, PROJECT.md has history. This command gathers "what's next", updates PROJECT.md, then continues through the full requirements → roadmap cycle.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — updated with new milestone goals
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional, focuses on NEW features)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements for this milestone
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure (continues numbering)
- `.planning/STATE.md` — reset for new milestone

**After this command:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase [N]` to start execution.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.claude/get-shit-done/references/questioning.md
@./.claude/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
@./.claude/get-shit-done/templates/project.md
@./.claude/get-shit-done/templates/requirements.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Milestone name: $ARGUMENTS (optional - will prompt if not provided)

**Load project context:**
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/STATE.md
@.planning/MILESTONES.md
@.planning/config.json

**Load milestone context (if exists, from /gsd:discuss-milestone):**
@.planning/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md
</context>

<process>

## Phase 1: Load Context

- Read PROJECT.md (existing project, Validated requirements, decisions)
- Read MILESTONES.md (what shipped previously)
- Read STATE.md (pending todos, blockers)
- Check for MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md (from /gsd:discuss-milestone)

## Phase 2: Gather Milestone Goals

**If MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md exists:**
- Use features and scope from discuss-milestone
- Present summary for confirmation

**If no context file:**
- Present what shipped in last milestone
- Ask: "What do you want to build next?"
- Use AskUserQuestion to explore features
- Probe for priorities, constraints, scope

## Phase 3: Determine Milestone Version

- Parse last version from MILESTONES.md
- Suggest next version (v1.0 → v1.1, or v2.0 for major)
- Confirm with user

## Phase 4: Update PROJECT.md

Add/update these sections:

```markdown
## Current Milestone: v[X.Y] [Name]

**Goal:** [One sentence describing milestone focus]

**Target features:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
```

Update Active requirements section with new goals.

Update "Last updated" footer.

## Phase 5: Update STATE.md

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: [today] — Milestone v[X.Y] started
```

Keep Accumulated Context section (decisions, blockers) from previous milestone.

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Commit

Delete MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md if exists (consumed).

Check planning config:
```bash
COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"commit_docs"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[^,}]*' | grep -o 'true\|false' || echo "true")
git check-ignore -q .planning 2>/dev/null && COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false
```

If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false`: Skip git operations

If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=true` (default):
```bash
git add .planning/PROJECT.md .planning/STATE.md
git commit -m "docs: start milestone v[X.Y] [Name]"
```

## Phase 6.5: Resolve Model Profile

Read model profile for agent spawning:

```bash
MODEL_PROFILE=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"model_profile"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Default to "balanced" if not set.

**Model lookup table:**

| Agent | quality | balanced | budget |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| gsd-project-researcher | opus | sonnet | haiku |
| gsd-research-synthesizer | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |
| gsd-roadmapper | opus | sonnet | sonnet |

Store resolved models for use in Task calls below.

## Phase 7: Research Decision

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem for new features before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover patterns, expected features, architecture for NEW capabilities
  - "Skip research" — I know what I need, go straight to requirements

**If "Research first":**

Files: `.planning/research/`
```

**If "Skip research":** Continue to Phase 8.

## Phase 8: Define Requirements

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Load context:**

Read PROJECT.md and extract:
- Core value (the ONE thing that must work)
- Current milestone goals
- Validated requirements (what already exists)

**If research exists:** Read research/FEATURES.md and extract feature categories.

**Present features by category:**

```
Here are the features for [new capabilities]:

## [Category 1]
**Table stakes:**
- Feature A
- Feature B

**Differentiators:**
- Feature C
- Feature D

**Research notes:** [any relevant notes]

---

## [Next Category]
...
```

**If no research:** Gather requirements through conversation instead.

Ask: "What are the main things users need to be able to do with [new features]?"

For each capability mentioned:
- Ask clarifying questions to make it specific
- Probe for related capabilities
- Group into categories

**Scope each category:**

For each category, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "[Category name]"
- question: "Which [category] features are in this milestone?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "[Feature 1]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 2]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 3]" — [brief description]
  - "None for this milestone" — Defer entire category

Track responses:
- Selected features → this milestone's requirements
- Unselected table stakes → future milestone
- Unselected differentiators → out of scope

**Identify gaps:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Additions"
- question: "Any requirements research missed? (Features specific to your vision)"
- options:
  - "No, research covered it" — Proceed
  - "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Generate REQUIREMENTS.md:**

Create `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` with:
- v1 Requirements for THIS milestone grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs)
- Future Requirements (deferred to later milestones)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions with reasoning)
- Traceability section (empty, filled by roadmap)

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, NOTIF-02)

Continue numbering from existing requirements if applicable.

**Requirement quality criteria:**

Good requirements are:
- **Specific and testable:** "User can reset password via email link" (not "Handle password reset")
- **User-centric:** "User can X" (not "System does Y")
- **Atomic:** One capability per requirement (not "User can login and manage profile")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

**Present full requirements list:**

Show every requirement (not counts) for user confirmation:

```
## Milestone v[X.Y] Requirements

### [Category 1]
- [ ] **CAT1-01**: User can do X
- [ ] **CAT1-02**: User can do Y

### [Category 2]
- [ ] **CAT2-01**: User can do Z

[... full list ...]

---

Does this capture what you're building? (yes / adjust)
```

If "adjust": Return to scoping.

**Commit requirements:**

Check planning config (same pattern as Phase 6).

If committing:
```bash
git add .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: define milestone v[X.Y] requirements

[X] requirements across [N] categories
EOF
)"
```

## Phase 9: Create Roadmap

Display stage banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► CREATING ROADMAP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

◆ Spawning roadmapper...
```

**Determine starting phase number:**

Read MILESTONES.md to find the last phase number from previous milestone.
New phases continue from there (e.g., if v1.0 ended at phase 5, v1.1 starts at phase 6).

Spawn gsd-roadmapper agent with context:

```
Task(prompt="
<planning_context>

**Project:**
@.planning/PROJECT.md

**Requirements:**
@.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

**Research (if exists):**
@.planning/research/SUMMARY.md

**Config:**
@.planning/config.json

**Previous milestone (for phase numbering):**
@.planning/MILESTONES.md

</planning_context>

<instructions>
Create roadmap for milestone v[X.Y]:
1. Start phase numbering from [N] (continues from previous milestone)
2. Derive phases from THIS MILESTONE's requirements (don't include validated/existing)
3. Map every requirement to exactly one phase
4. Derive 2-5 success criteria per phase (observable user behaviors)
5. Validate 100% coverage of new requirements
6. Write files immediately (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability)
7. Return ROADMAP CREATED with summary

Write files first, then return. This ensures artifacts persist even if context is lost.
</instructions>
", subagent_type="gsd-roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", description="Create roadmap")
```

**Handle roadmapper return:**

**If `## ROADMAP BLOCKED`:**
- Present blocker information
- Work with user to resolve
- Re-spawn when resolved

**If `## ROADMAP CREATED`:**

Read the created ROADMAP.md and present it nicely inline:

```

| # | Phase | Goal | Requirements | Success Criteria |
|---|-------|------|--------------|------------------|

**CRITICAL: Ask for approval before committing:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Roadmap"
- question: "Does this roadmap structure work for you?"
- options:
  - "Approve" — Commit and continue
  - "Adjust phases" — Tell me what to change
  - "Review full file" — Show raw ROADMAP.md

**If "Approve":** Continue to commit.

**If "Adjust phases":**
- Get user's adjustment notes
- Re-spawn roadmapper with revision context:
  ```
  Task(prompt="
  <revision>
  User feedback on roadmap:
  [user's notes]

  Current ROADMAP.md: @.planning/ROADMAP.md

  Update the roadmap based on feedback. Edit files in place.
  Return ROADMAP REVISED with changes made.
  </revision>
  ", subagent_type="gsd-roadmapper", model="{roadmapper_model}", description="Revise roadmap")
  ```
- Present revised roadmap
- Loop until user approves

**If "Review full file":** Display raw `cat .planning/ROADMAP.md`, then re-ask.

**Commit roadmap (after approval):**

Check planning config (same pattern as Phase 6).

If committing:
```bash
git add .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: create milestone v[X.Y] roadmap ([N] phases)

Phases:
