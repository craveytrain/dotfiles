# IMPORTANT: The [tools] header should ONLY be in this file (dev-tools module).
# Language-specific modules (node, ruby, etc.) should NOT repeat the [tools] header
# because it causes merge issues when configurations are concatenated.
# Other modules should only include the tool definitions without the header.
