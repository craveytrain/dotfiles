<objective>

Output: Clean repository with only GSD planning structure.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove SpecKit specs directory</name>
  <files>specs/ (directory removal)</files>
  <action>
Remove the entire specs/ directory which contains legacy SpecKit artifacts:
- specs/001-ghostty-module/spec.md
- specs/001-ghostty-module/plan.md
- specs/001-ghostty-module/research.md
- specs/001-ghostty-module/checklists/requirements.md

The valuable information has already been captured in:
- .planning/phases/01-foundation-ghostty-module/01-RESEARCH.md (research findings)
- .planning/PROJECT.md (requirements)

Commands:
```bash
rm -rf specs/
```

Do NOT remove docs/policy/ - these are Constitutional documents that remain relevant.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `ls specs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "specs/ removed"` - should show "specs/ removed"
Run: `ls docs/policy/CONSTITUTION.md` - should still exist (not removed)
  </verify>
  <done>SpecKit specs/ directory removed, Constitutional docs preserved</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After task completes:
1. `ls specs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "removed"` confirms specs/ gone
2. `ls docs/policy/` still shows CONSTITUTION.md and other policy docs
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- specs/ directory no longer exists
- docs/policy/ remains intact with Constitutional documents
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-ghostty-module/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
