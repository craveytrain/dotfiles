|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| 01 | 01 | Removed SpecKit artifacts after GSD migration | All valuable research captured in GSD docs, no need for parallel planning systems |
| 01 | 01 | Preserved Constitutional docs in docs/policy/ | Governance documents remain relevant, not planning artifacts |
| 01 | 02 | Removed duplicate 1password entry | Tech debt cleanup before adding new modules |
